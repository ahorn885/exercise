# V5 Implementation — WS-H: Event Windows — Slice 3: category equipment baselines (F8) — Closing Handoff

**Session:** Built **Slice 3** of the Event-Windows arc — category equipment baselines (design §F8). A not-yet-logged locale (an away destination created inline per Slice 2b, or a cold home gym) now **assumes** an authored, per-category equipment + terrain baseline until the athlete logs actuals on arrival → which then refreshes the window (the arrival-regen loop). This is **what makes "away" useful cold** — before, a never-logged destination resolved empty and degraded every discipline to near-strength.
**Date:** 2026-06-14
**Predecessor handoff:** `V5_Implementation_WSH_EventWindows_Slice2b_InlineCreate_2026_06_14_Closing_Handoff_v1.md` (Slice 2b inline-create, PR #601 merged + live).
**Branch:** `claude/v5-wsh-eventwindows-inline-create-rt69cq` (PR [#603](https://github.com/ahorn885/exercise/pull/603) — **OPEN, not merged**). *(Harness-pinned branch name reads "inline-create" / Slice 2b; actual scope is Slice 3. Kept per the session's explicit "never push to a different branch" instruction rather than renamed.)*
**Spec/arc:** `designs/Event_Windows_Design_v1.md` §F8 + §6 (Slice 3). **North-star:** `plans/Feasibility_Saturation_And_Locale_Retirement_Plan_v1.md` §2 WS-H. **Epic:** [#581](https://github.com/ahorn885/exercise/issues/581).

## 1. Session-start verification (Rule #9)

Ran `./scripts/verify-handoff.sh` against the Slice-2b handoff — all green, tree clean, branch correct, §8 anchors present on disk (the `event_windows.html` inline-create link; `new_locale`/`_stash_return_to`/`_locale_flow_redirect`; the render-smoke test). No drift — Slice 2b is genuinely merged + live.

---

## 2. Decisions (Andy-ratified in-session, 2026-06-14)

Slice 3 trips **Trigger #2** (the baseline *contents* are reference data) + **Trigger #3** (new layer0 table) + **Trigger #1** (the overlay wording). Stopped and got sign-off before building. The decisions, in the order they were settled:

1. **Storage / authoring model** — Andy initially said "wherever they live now, do not create new values," then corrected: *"the baselines need to be created… single baseline that we edit."* → **one authored, editable baseline per logical category** (a layer0 seed table we maintain), **not** a crowd aggregate.
2. **Scope of "single baseline"** — **one authored list per category**, for §F8's set, which became **4** once pools were added: **commercial / hotel / climbing / pool**.
3. **Transition** — **replace** (the baseline applies only when the locale has zero logged equipment / zero logged terrain; any logged value fully wins).
4. **Apply scope** — **universal** (home + away). The away env already resolves through `cluster_equipment_by_locale` / `cluster_terrain_by_locale`, so this needed **no away-path change**; a cold home locale benefits too.
5. **Pools** — added a **4th** (pool) baseline; it is **terrain-only** (there is no `Pool` equipment row — swimming is terrain-gated by `TRN-008`).
6. **Overlay mark (Trigger #1)** — yes: a cold away segment shows a "log actuals on arrival to refine this window" note.
7. **Contents (Trigger #2)** — ratified item-by-item (see §3). Two name corrections surfaced during reconciliation (`Rowing machine`→`Rowing ergometer`; `Pool` is terrain not equipment) and one self-inflicted scare (`bosu` "missing" was a grep bug — `BOSU ball` is canonical under `Plyo, Power & Stability`; **no vocabulary drift**).

---

## 3. The four baselines (ratified contents)

Keyed by **logical category**; the 5 gym + 2 pool `MANUAL_CATEGORIES` slugs collapse to these 4 via `locations._CATEGORY_BASELINE_KEY`.

| Baseline (slugs) | Equipment (exact `equipment_items` canonical names) | Terrain |
|---|---|---|
| **commercial** (`commercial_chain_gym`, `independent_gym`) | Dip bars, Foam roller, Pull-up bar, Resistance band, TRX / suspension trainer, Yoga mat, Barbell, Bench, Dumbbell, EZ curl bar, Kettlebell, Squat rack, Weight plates, Elliptical, Rowing ergometer, Stationary bike, Treadmill, Cable machine, Chest press machine, Lat pulldown machine, Leg press machine, Seated row machine, Smith machine, BOSU ball, Battle ropes, Medicine ball, Plyo box, Stability ball | TRN-001, TRN-016 |
| **hotel** (`hotel_gym`) | Dumbbell, Treadmill, Stationary bike, Elliptical, Bench press rack, Yoga mat, Stability ball | TRN-001, TRN-016 |
| **climbing** (`climbing_gym_chain`, `climbing_gym_indie`) | Climbing Wall, Hangboard, Crash pad, Pull-up bar | TRN-001, TRN-016, TRN-014 |
| **pool** (`pool_indoor`, `pool_outdoor`) | *(terrain-only)* | TRN-008 |

Terrain ids: `TRN-001` Road/Paved, `TRN-016` Indoor/Gym, `TRN-014` Climbing Gym, `TRN-008` Pool.

## 4. Implementation

- **`etl/migrations/layer0/0005_seed_location_category_baseline.sql`** (NEW) — `CREATE TABLE layer0.location_category_equipment_baseline (category, equipment_tags TEXT[], terrain_ids TEXT[], etl_version, etl_run_at, superseded_at)` + the 4 seed rows + a verify block. **Verify block:** row-count (=4, hard) + terrain-id FK-check against `terrain_types` (hard) + equipment-tag FK-check against `equipment_items` (**NOTICE, see §6**).
- **`locations.py`** — `load_category_baselines` (`try/except`→`{}` if table absent; reuses `_coerce_terrain_ids` as the generic TEXT[] coercer); `_CATEGORY_BASELINE_KEY` (5+2→4) + `_BASELINE_DISPLAY`; `_category_baseline` + `_locale_category` (its own query so the existing `gym_profile_id`/`locale_terrain_ids` SELECTs are unchanged); `locale_assumed_baseline_display` (the overlay flag — cold = no logged equipment AND no logged terrain); and the substitution inside `cluster_equipment_by_locale` + `cluster_terrain_by_locale`, **gated behind `if baselines and not <logged set>`** so a baseline-unaware caller (pre-migration, or a SQL-shape test fake) is byte-identical. Rule #15: each substitution logs `assumed_baseline=… (category=… no logged equipment/terrain)`.
- **`layer4/orchestrator.py`** — registered `"location_category_equipment_baseline": "0C"` in `_LAYER0_TABLE_FAMILY`; in the away branch, `assumed_baseline = locations.locale_assumed_baseline_display(...)` → passed to `EventWindowSegment(assumed_baseline_category=…)` (+ folded into the Rule #15 `_away_dbg` line). **No resolution change** — the away cluster's equipment/terrain already flow through the two cluster fns, which now substitute the baseline for the cold destination.
- **`layer4/session_feasibility.py`** — `EventWindowSegment.assumed_baseline_category: str | None = None`.
- **`layer4/per_phase.py`** — `_event_window_label` appends the Trigger-#1 note when `segment.assumed_baseline_category` is set: *`[Equipment/terrain at "<dest>" is assumed from the standard <category> baseline — log the gym's actual equipment on arrival to refine the plan for this window.]`*

**Cache:** the table is in `_LAYER0_TABLE_FAMILY` (0C), and `etl_version_set` is folded into `plan_create_key`/`plan_refresh_key`, so a baseline edit (supersede + bumped `etl_version`) busts the affected plan caches (home **and** away). For a *home* cold locale the resolved `terrain_feasibility` hash already captures it; for *away* the digest is the path (away feasibility is in `compute_event_windows_hash`, which intentionally doesn't hash resolved equipment).

**5 substantive files** (migration, `locations.py`, `orchestrator.py`, `session_feasibility.py`, `per_phase.py`) — at the ceiling; tests not counted.

---

## 5. Tests

- **`tests/test_layer4_location_baselines.py`** (NEW, 19 cases) — `load_category_baselines` parse + absent-table-degrades; the equipment substitution (cold→assume, logged-wins, non-baseline-category stays empty, pool-has-no-equipment, absent-table-no-op); the terrain substitution (cold→assume, pool→TRN-008, logged-wins); `locale_assumed_baseline_display` (cold→label, equipment-logged→None, terrain-logged→None, non-baseline-category→None, absent-table→None); and a **drift guard** asserting `_CATEGORY_BASELINE_KEY` covers exactly the non-residential, non-park `MANUAL_CATEGORIES` slugs.
- **`tests/test_layer4_event_windows.py`** +2 — the overlay note renders on a cold away segment / is absent when the destination is logged.
- **`tests/test_layer4_orchestrator.py`** +1 — `_LAYER0_TABLE_FAMILY` includes the new table (0C).

**Full suite: 2452 passed / 30 skipped.** Env: `python -m venv /tmp/venv && /tmp/venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt pytest`, full `tests/`.

**Layer-0 gate reproduced locally → PASS** (schema + genesis v1.6.7 + migrations 0001–0005 + `validate_layer0`), as `pgrunner` per the CARRY_FORWARD recipe.

---

## 6. CI note — the genesis-vs-live drift (why the equipment FK-check is a NOTICE)

The first push **failed** the Layer-0 integrity gate. Root cause: the gate loads the **frozen genesis snapshot** (`etl/output/layer0_etl_v1.6.7.sql`, the latest `sort -V`) + the `etl/migrations/layer0/*.sql` migrations — it does **not** load the `etl/sources/*.sql` equipment additions. So three live canonical tokens — **`Bench press rack`** (batch_a), **`Climbing Wall`** (K2), **`Crash pad`** (K3) — are present on Neon but **absent from CI's genesis**. A hard `RAISE EXCEPTION` equipment FK-check failed the gate on that pre-existing drift.

**Fix (commit 2):** the 0005 equipment FK-check is a **`RAISE NOTICE`**, not `EXCEPTION` — it stays silent on the authoritative Neon apply (where all tokens exist) and surfaces a genuine typo there, while not failing CI's incomplete genesis. The **terrain** FK-check + the row-count stay **hard** (terrain ids are all in genesis). This drift is **pre-existing and broader than this slice** (etl/sources additions were never folded into a genesis snapshot or migration) — left as-is, not fixed here. Possible future cleanup: fold the etl/sources equipment additions into a migration so CI genesis matches live.

## 7. Owed Andy's hands

- ⛔ **BLOCKING (pre-merge): apply migration `0005` on Neon before merging/deploying #603.** The `etl_version_set` digest UNION queries `layer0.location_category_equipment_baseline` on **every** plan-gen, so deploying ahead of the migration crashes plan-gen (apply-first ordering, same as 0004). The migration is idempotent + self-validating (terrain FK + row-count hard; equipment NOTICE silent when clean).
- (carried, unrelated) the post-#572 live **T3 *refresh*** re-verify (diag token + Andy pasting logs, Rule #14).

## 8. Next session

- **Slice 4 — away craft** (the literal WS-H [#581](https://github.com/ahorn885/exercise/issues/581) (b)+(c)): craft↔locale ∪ craft↔window → populates the away env's `owned_crafts`, today hard-coded `[]` (F4) at `orchestrator.py` away branch. Needs DDL (`athlete_craft_locale` + a window craft carrier) — design-first, Trigger #3.
- **Slice 5 — capture UX polish** (nav-link to `/profile/event-windows`; plan-gen review panel; the 2b round-trip form-state preservation).
- (split out) #592 race-location terrain/weather; #593 reduced-volume travel days.
