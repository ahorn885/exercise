# Provider Inbound Mapping Matrix (#681 Wave 2) — v1

**Status (v2, 2026-06-18):** §1 **RATIFIED** = option C (fine layer0 D-id + deterministic coarse collapse; the matrix is authored for it). **§6 Rowing mint — REVERSED by Andy 2026-06-18:** on-water rowing (the traditional sport) is **not frequent in our market and will never appear as a race leg**, so we do **NOT** mint a Rowing discipline (the v1 provisional **D-033 is dropped**). Rowing is recorded **bucket-3**, and erg-rowing as a *training* substitute already routes through the existing `Rowing ergometer` equipment machine. The framing this revision adds — **§12: discipline vs. training-modality/equipment** — generalizes that call. Matrix content reference-ready for Strava/Oura/WHOOP (§2–4) + Wahoo/RWGPS (§10) + TP/Zwift (§11); remaining roster per §7. **Spec/reference only — no code ships from this doc.** *(v1 — which ratified the D-033 mint — is superseded under `archive/superseded-specs/`.)*

**Type:** Reference (seed data for the future `provider_value_map`). This doc is the **full-roster extension of `Provider_Data_Translation_Layer_Spec` §6** (which seeded only Garmin strength+cardio and Polar/COROS wellness as Wave 1). Every mapping row here is a future `provider_value_map(provider, data_type, direction='in', source_value, canonical_kind, canonical_value, match_kind, confidence, no_canonical_match)` seed row (parent §4.2).

**Parent:** `specs/Provider_Data_Translation_Layer_Spec` (RATIFIED v1) — owns the canonical model (§2: metric keys, SI units, disciplines, HR zones), the 3-bucket inbound model (§1.1), the storage schema (§4), and the authoring workflow (§7). This doc does **not** redefine any of that; it populates the matrix against it.

**Batch 1 (§2–4):** **Strava, Oura, WHOOP** — the three highest-value non-Garmin consumer providers. They span both canonical targets (Strava → discipline crosswalk + activity metrics; Oura/WHOOP → the §2.3 metric registry + §2.4 HR zones) and exercise all three buckets (Strava's `Pickleball` → bucket-3; WHOOP `recovery_score` / Oura readiness → bucket-2).

**Batch 2 (§10):** **Wahoo + RWGPS** (added 2026-06-17) — cardio/cycling activity platforms (the wired/next-to-wire pair).

**Batch 3 (§11):** **TrainingPeaks + Zwift** (added 2026-06-18) — structured-workout *destination* platforms; documented mainly to record that their value is **outbound** (parent Wave 3b) and that neither is a clean first-class inbound connector (TP is partner-access-gated; Zwift has no inbound API). Remaining providers (MyFitnessPal, Apple/Samsung/Google Health) are later batches — §7.

**All provider field names, units, and enum values below are sourced from each provider's official developer docs (URLs in each provider's "Sources" line), fetched 2026-06-17. Anything not confirmable against an official doc is flagged inline.**

## 0. How to read a mapping row

Each row records: the **provider source value** → the **canonical target** (one of parent §2's key families) → the **bucket** (parent §1.1):

- **Bucket 1 — Mapped:** the provider value has a canonical counterpart → `no_canonical_match=false`, `canonical_value` set.
- **Bucket 2 — Proprietary/unmodeled:** record raw, attributed to provider, **may never surface** (`no_canonical_match=true`, dormant). E.g. WHOOP `recovery_score`, Oura readiness score.
- **Bucket 3 — Real activity we don't prescribe:** record raw **AND surface in completed history** (`no_canonical_match=true`, surfaced). E.g. a Strava `Pickleball` game.

`match_kind` = authoring provenance (`exact` enum/field match · `manual` curated judgment · `fuzzy` rapidfuzz candidate, parent §7). The unit column gives the **edge conversion** to canonical SI (parent §2.2); "—" = already canonical.

## 1. DECISION (needs Andy) — the cardio-activity discipline target: fine D-id vs coarse `_plan_sport_type`

**The question:** when a provider reports a completed cardio activity type (`TrailRun`, `BackcountrySki`, `Kayaking`), what canonical value do we store?

We have **two** discipline representations, and parent §2.1 names both ("discipline id / `_plan_sport_type`") without resolving which the inbound target is:

| Representation | Vocabulary | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Fine layer0 discipline canon** | 24 ids — D-001 Trail Running, D-002 Road Running, D-003 Trekking, D-004 Swimming, D-006 Road Cycling, D-007 TT Cycling, D-008 MTB, D-009 Packrafting, D-010 Kayaking, D-011 Canoeing, D-012 Rock Climbing, D-013 Abseiling, D-014 Via Ferrata, D-017 Snowshoeing, D-018 Mountaineering, D-019 Paddle Rafting, D-021 Uphill Skinning, D-022 Alpine Descent, D-024 Mountain Running, D-027 OCR, D-028 XC Skiing, D-030 Gravel Cycling, D-031 XC Cycling, D-032 SUP | `etl/layer0/discipline_canon.CANONICAL_NAMES` |
| **Coarse `_plan_sport_type`** | 6 values — `running`, `cycling`, `swimming`, `strength_training`, `hiking`, `walking` | `garmin_connect.GARMIN_TYPE_TO_PLAN_SPORT` targets (the wired Garmin path; parent §6.2's named seed) |

**The tension is load-bearing for this app.** The coarse set is a Garmin-era artifact with **no skiing, paddling, or climbing** — yet those are exactly AIDSTATION's market thesis (skimo, AR, marathon paddle, swimrun). The fine canon **has** them (D-021 skinning, D-010 kayak, D-012 climb, D-017 snowshoe, D-032 SUP). Mapping a Strava `BackcountrySki` or `Kayaking` to bucket-3 — because the thin coarse target lacks it — would throw away the multisport signal the product exists to capture.

**Options:**

- **(A) Coarse `_plan_sport_type` target.** Consistent with the wired Garmin path (parent §6.2) and semantically "activity modality." But thin (6 values) → skiing/paddling/climbing/rowing all fall to bucket-3, losing real endurance signal.
- **(B) Fine layer0 D-id target.** High-fidelity (the parent's "MuleSoft" north star); faithful for the multisport disciplines. Cost: D-ids carry race-classification semantics (they drive Layer 2A composition), so reusing them as an *activity*-ingest target is a slight semantic stretch, and some provider activities (Walk, Elliptical, Rowing) still have no D-id → bucket-3.
- **(C) Fine D-id primary + a deterministic D-id→coarse collapse (RECOMMENDED).** Store the fine D-id where one exists (faithful, lossless); derive the coarse `_plan_sport_type` for plan-item matching via a one-time ~6-bucket collapse table (D-001/002/024→`running`; D-006/007/008/030/031→`cycling`; D-004→`swimming`; D-003/017→`hiking`; etc.). Provider types with no D-id but a coarse home (Walk→`walking`) map coarse-only. Types with neither (Rowing, Snowboard, Elliptical) → bucket-3 (training modalities/equipment, not disciplines — §12; a §6 candidate-discipline flag only where it could be a race leg).

**Recommendation: (C). → RATIFIED by Andy 2026-06-17.** It mirrors the #679 strength principle exactly — *preserve specificity, collapse is a backstop* (subtype-preferred EX-id, category-collapse only when no specific home) — and it's the only option that doesn't discard the skimo/paddle/climb signal. The collapse is mechanical and lossless (fine→coarse is deterministic; the reverse isn't, so storing fine loses nothing). The matrix below is authored on **(C)** — each cardio row gives the fine D-id and the coarse collapse. **Build-wave consequence:** `cardio_log` ingest must carry the fine D-id (the wired Garmin path stores coarse today) + a deterministic D-id→`_plan_sport_type` collapse table.

**Gut check:** (C)'s cost is that no current inbound path *consumes* a fine D-id for a completed activity (the wired Garmin path stores coarse), so the build wave that lands `provider_value_map` also has to teach `cardio_log` ingest to carry the D-id — slightly more than a like-for-like swap. If you'd rather ship the smallest thing first, (A) is defensible and the fine ids become a later fidelity upgrade. Either way the provider's **raw** sub-type is kept (record-don't-drop), so fidelity is never *lost* — the only question is whether it's mapped-canonical or sits raw.

## 2. Strava — `activity` (cardio) + `body`

**Mechanism:** OAuth2 REST + Webhook Events API (one push subscription/app; webhook is a lightweight `{object_type, object_id, aspect_type, owner_id, ...}` event — must 200 within 2s — then you GET the activity over REST). Read scopes: `activity:read[_all]` (activities + webhooks), `profile:read_all` (the `/athlete/zones` endpoint). Rate limit 200/15min, 2000/day (upgradable). Mechanism class = OAuth REST + webhook (parent §5).

**Data types Strava provides:** `cardio` (rich) + `body` (two single profile fields only). **Strava has NO sleep / HRV / resting-HR / recovery / SpO2 / respiration / VO2max / body-fat data** — those data types are **N/A for Strava** (confirmed against the `DetailedAthlete` model; Strava is an activity platform, not a wellness device). This matters: Strava is a cardio+body connector only.

### 2.1 Activity metrics — `DetailedActivity` / `SummaryActivity` (data_type=`cardio`)

| Strava field | Unit | Canonical target | Bucket | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `distance` | m | distance (m) | 1 | — (verbatim "in meters") |
| `moving_time` / `elapsed_time` | s | duration (s) | 1 | — |
| `total_elevation_gain`, `elev_high`, `elev_low` | m | elevation (m) | 1 | no canonical elevation key yet (raw) |
| `average_speed` / `max_speed` | m/s | speed (m/s) | 1 | — |
| `average_watts` / `weighted_average_watts` / `max_watts` | W | power (W) | 1 | rides w/ power meter only; `weighted_average_watts` = Strava's NP estimate |
| `device_watts` | bool | power provenance flag | 1 | false = estimated |
| `calories` | kcal | energy (kcal) | 1 | "kilocalories" — already canonical |
| `kilojoules` | **kJ** | energy (kcal) | 1 | **÷4.184** — rides only; mechanical work, NOT the same as `calories` |
| `average_heartrate` / `max_heartrate` | bpm | `hr_avg_bpm` / `hr_peak_bpm` | 1 | ⚠️ **observed-not-guaranteed** — present in real responses but absent from Strava's documented `SummaryActivity`/`DetailedActivity` schema (formally documented only on segment-effort/lap). Map, but don't assume schema guarantees. |
| `average_cadence`, `average_temp` | spm/rpm, °C | cadence / temp | 1 | same observed-not-guaranteed caveat; units unverified at activity level |
| `suffer_score` | — | **bucket-2** (Relative Effort) | 2 | HR-derived training-load number; often `null`; no canonical home → record raw |
| `sport_type` | enum | **discipline** (§2.2) | 1/3 | the primary discipline signal |
| `type` | enum (deprecated) | discipline (legacy) | — | key off `sport_type`; `type` collapses the new sub-types — fallback only |

### 2.2 `sport_type` enum → discipline (the key deliverable; 56 values, mapped to our canon per §1 option C)

`match_kind=manual` for every row (curated judgment). Fine D-id + coarse collapse + bucket:

| Strava `sport_type` | Fine D-id | Coarse | Bucket | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Run` | D-002 Road Running | running | 1 | |
| `TrailRun` | D-001 Trail Running | running | 1 | |
| `VirtualRun` | D-002 (closest) | running | 1 | treadmill/virtual — no distinct canon; raw kept |
| `Ride` | D-006 Road Cycling | cycling | 1 | |
| `VirtualRide` | D-006 (closest) | cycling | 1 | indoor/Zwift — no indoor-cycling canon; raw kept |
| `MountainBikeRide` | D-008 MTB | cycling | 1 | |
| `EMountainBikeRide` | D-008 MTB | cycling | 1 | e-assist — flag in raw |
| `GravelRide` | D-030 Gravel Cycling | cycling | 1 | |
| `EBikeRide` | D-006 Road Cycling | cycling | 1 | e-assist — flag in raw |
| `Handcycle` | D-006 (closest) | cycling | 1 | adaptive — flag in raw |
| `Velomobile` | D-006 (closest) | cycling | 1 | |
| `Swim` | D-004 Swimming | swimming | 1 | Strava has no pool/open-water split (raw kept) |
| `Hike` | D-003 Trekking | hiking | 1 | our "Trekking" absorbed Hiking |
| `Snowshoe` | D-017 Snowshoeing | hiking | 1 | we have this discipline |
| `Kayaking` | D-010 Kayaking | — | 1 | no coarse home; fine-only |
| `Canoeing` | D-011 Canoeing | — | 1 | fine-only |
| `StandUpPaddling` | D-032 SUP | — | 1 | fine-only |
| `RockClimbing` | D-012 Rock Climbing | — | 1 | fine-only |
| `AlpineSki` | D-022 Alpine Descent | — | 1 | fine-only |
| `NordicSki` | D-028 XC Skiing | — | 1 | fine-only |
| `BackcountrySki` | D-021 Uphill Skinning | — | 1 | fine-only (the skimo signal) |
| `RollerSki` | D-028 (closest, dryland) | — | 1 | flag in raw |
| `WeightTraining` | — | strength_training | 1 | coarse-only; strength is the EX-id/rx world, not a race discipline |
| `Walk` | — | walking | 1 | coarse-only (no race-discipline equivalent) |
| `Crossfit`, `HighIntensityIntervalTraining` | — | *(none)* | 3 | **bucket-3 — training modality, not a discipline** (§12). Conditioning, not a race discipline nor a barbell-strength log; record raw. |
| `Rowing`, `VirtualRow` | *(none)* | *(none)* | 3 | **bucket-3 — training modality, not a discipline** (§12; mint reversed Andy 2026-06-18). Won't be a race leg; erg-rowing routes via the existing `Rowing ergometer` machine. Record raw. |
| `Snowboard` | *(none)* | *(none)* | 3 | not in market vocab → bucket-3 |
| `Workout`, `Elliptical`, `StairStepper`, `Wheelchair` | *(none)* | *(none)* | 3 | bucket-3, record + surface. **`StairStepper`/`Elliptical` are indoor *machines*, not disciplines** (§12) — record raw + the indoor-machine flag; `Stair climber` already maps to D-003/017/018/024 in the Layer-4 feasibility cascade. |
| `Surfing`, `Kitesurf`, `Windsurf`, `Sail`, `IceSkate`, `InlineSkate`, `Skateboard` | *(none)* | *(none)* | 3 | not programmed → bucket-3 |
| `Golf`, `Yoga`, `Pilates`, `PhysicalTherapy`, `Soccer`, `Basketball`, `Volleyball`, `Cricket`, `Tennis`, `TableTennis`, `Badminton`, `Squash`, `Racquetball`, `Pickleball`, `Padel`, `Dance` | *(none)* | *(none)* | 3 | "real activity we don't prescribe" — the parent §1.1 bucket-3 exemplar (Pickleball) |

### 2.3 Strava `body` (data_type=`body`)

| Strava field | Unit | Canonical | Bucket | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DetailedAthlete.weight` | kg **or** lb | `body_mass_kg` | 1 | unit follows `measurement_preference` (`meters`→kg, `feet`→lb); **current value only, not a time series**; `profile:write` can set it |
| `DetailedAthlete.ftp` | W | `ftp_w` | 1 | "Functional Threshold Power"; current value only; settable via `profile:write` |

> Strava is the **only Batch-1 provider that sources `ftp_w`** — worth noting for the registry (parent §2.3 had `ftp_w` as "not yet surfaced").

### 2.4 Strava HR/power zones (data_type=`zone`)

`GET /athlete/zones` (needs `profile:read_all`) → `{heart_rate:{custom_zones, zones:[{min,max}...]}, power:{zones:[{min,max}...]}}`. Ordered `{min,max}` boundary arrays (HR bpm / power W), **no semantic labels**, count **not** contractually 5 (athlete `custom_zones`). **Normalize:** map array index→Z1…Z5 by position, **guard zone count ≠ 5** (don't force). Per-activity time-in-zone (`ActivityZone`/`TimedZoneRange`) is a paid (Summit) feature → bucket-2 raw when present.

### 2.5 Strava bucket-2 (record raw, dormant)

`suffer_score` (Relative Effort) · per-activity time-in-zone distributions (Summit) · `segment_efforts`/`best_efforts` (`pr_rank`/`kom_rank`/achievements) · social counters (`kudos_count`, `achievement_count`, …). **Fitness/Freshness/Form (CTL/ATL/TSB) is NOT exposed by the public API** — unavailable, not bucket-2.

## 3. WHOOP — `recovery` / `sleep` / `cycle` / `workout` / `body`

**Mechanism:** OAuth2 REST **v2** (`/v2/...`; v1 unsupported as of the v2 launch 2025-07-01 — v1 webhooks removed, sleep/workout ids are now **UUIDs**). Webhooks for `workout.updated/deleted`, `sleep.updated/deleted`, `recovery.updated/deleted` (creates arrive as "updated"; **no** cycle/body webhooks — poll those). Scopes: `read:recovery`, `read:sleep`, `read:workout`, `read:cycles`, `read:body_measurement`, `offline`. Score objects appear only when `score_state == SCORED`. Mechanism class = OAuth REST + webhook (parent §5).

> **Unit corrections vs the parent's assumptions (verified against official sample payloads):** WHOOP HRV `hrv_rmssd_milli` is **already milliseconds** (sample `31.81`) → maps **1:1** to `hrv_rmssd_ms`, **no conversion**. Sleep stages **are** milliseconds (ms→min needed). Energy is **kilojoules** (kJ→kcal needed).

### 3.1 Recovery (data_type=`wellness`) — `recovery.score`

| WHOOP field | Unit | Canonical | Bucket | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `resting_heart_rate` | bpm | `resting_hr_bpm` | 1 | — |
| `hrv_rmssd_milli` | **ms** | `hrv_rmssd_ms` | 1 | **no conversion** — despite the `_milli` suffix the value is ms |
| `spo2_percentage` | % | `spo2_pct` | 1 | WHOOP 4.0+ only; nullable |
| `skin_temp_celsius` | °C | **bucket-2** | 2 | no canonical skin-temp key; record raw |
| `recovery_score` | 0–100% | **bucket-2** | 2 | proprietary recovery composite |
| `user_calibrating` | bool | **bucket-2** | 2 | new-user calibration flag |

### 3.2 Sleep (data_type=`sleep`) — `sleep.score`

| WHOOP field | Unit | Canonical | Bucket | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `stage_summary.total_slow_wave_sleep_time_milli` | **ms** | `sleep_deep_min` | 1 | **÷60000**; "slow wave" = deep |
| `stage_summary.total_rem_sleep_time_milli` | **ms** | `sleep_rem_min` | 1 | ÷60000 |
| `stage_summary.total_light_sleep_time_milli` | **ms** | `sleep_light_min` | 1 | ÷60000 |
| `stage_summary.total_in_bed_time_milli` | **ms** | `sleep_total_min` | 1 | ÷60000. ⚠️ **DECISION:** WHOOP has no single "asleep total" field — `sleep_total_min` = time-in-bed, **or** derive asleep = in_bed − awake − no_data (= light+sws+rem). Pick one convention (recommend **asleep** = Σstages, matching Polar/COROS "total sleep"). |
| `respiratory_rate` | brpm | `respiration_rate_brpm` | 1 | — |
| `sleep_performance_percentage` | % | **bucket-2** (WHOOP's "sleep score") | 2 | proprietary % vs sleep-need; **NOT** the §2.3 `sleep_score` (which is a 0–100 device composite — different scale/meaning). Map to `sleep_score` only if you accept the proprietary %. |
| `sleep_efficiency_percentage`, `sleep_consistency_percentage`, `disturbance_count`, `sleep_cycle_count`, `sleep_needed.*` | various | **bucket-2** | 2 | proprietary sleep model; record raw |

### 3.3 Cycle / strain (data_type=`wellness`) — `cycle.score`

| WHOOP field | Unit | Canonical | Bucket | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `average_heart_rate` | bpm | `hr_avg_bpm` | 1 | — |
| `max_heart_rate` | bpm | `hr_peak_bpm` | 1 | — |
| `kilojoule` | **kJ** | energy (kcal) | 1 | **÷4.184** — total daily energy expenditure. ⚠️ **NOT** `resting_metabolic_rate_kcal` (WHOOP exposes no RMR). |
| `strain` | 0–21 | **bucket-2** ("Day Strain") | 2 | proprietary |

### 3.4 Workout (data_type=`cardio`) — `workout` + `workout.score`

- **Sport:** `sport_name` (v2 string, e.g. `"running"`; key off this — `sport_id` int is legacy, gone after 2025-09-01). Representative map to our canon (per §1 option C): `running`→D-002·running · `cycling`→D-006·cycling · `swimming`→D-004·swimming · `hiking`/`rucking`→D-003·hiking · `walking`→walking(coarse) · `weightlifting`/`powerlifting`/`strength trainer`→strength_training · `spin`→D-006·cycling (indoor). WHOOP has **no trail-running or distinct indoor-cycling sport** (trail comes through as `running`; "Spin" ≈ indoor). The full enum is **~140 sports** (Yoga, Pickleball, HIIT, Functional Fitness, Elliptical, Sauna, …) — anything without a canonical discipline → **bucket-3**.
- **Metrics:** `average_heart_rate`→`hr_avg_bpm`, `max_heart_rate`→`hr_peak_bpm`, `distance_meter`→distance (m, —), `kilojoule`→energy (kJ→kcal ÷4.184), `altitude_gain_meter`/`altitude_change_meter`→elevation (m, raw). `strain`, `percent_recorded` → bucket-2.
- **Zones:** `zone_durations.zone_one_milli`…`zone_five_milli` → **Z1…Z5** (clean 1:1, ms→min/s). `zone_zero_milli` (sub-Z1, <50% maxHR) → **no canonical zone** (drop/bucket-2). ⚠️ The zone_one=Z1 binding is a **high-confidence inference** from WHOOP's published 5-zone (%maxHR / HRR-personalized) framework, not a verbatim API statement.

### 3.5 Body measurement (data_type=`body`) — `GET /v2/user/measurement/body`

| WHOOP field | Unit | Canonical | Bucket | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `weight_kilogram` | kg | `body_mass_kg` | 1 | **already kg** — no conversion |
| `height_meter` | m | height (m) | 1 | no canonical height key (raw) |
| `max_heart_rate` | bpm | **bucket-2** (user-level WHOOP-calc'd max) | 2 | reference value, not a measured peak |

> **WHOOP has NO source for** `body_fat_pct`, `vo2max_running`, `vo2max_cycling`, `ftp_w`, `resting_metabolic_rate_kcal` (body measurement = height/weight/maxHR only; `kilojoule` is total energy, not RMR). Mark those keys unmapped for WHOOP.

### 3.6 WHOOP bucket-2 (record raw, dormant)

`recovery_score`, `user_calibrating`, `skin_temp_celsius`, cycle/workout `strain`, `percent_recorded`, `sleep_performance/efficiency/consistency_percentage`, `disturbance_count`, `sleep_cycle_count`, `sleep_needed.*`, user-level `max_heart_rate`, `zone_zero` time.

## 4. Oura — `sleep` / `daily_sleep` / `daily_readiness` / `daily_activity` / `daily_spo2` / `vO2_max` / `workout`

**Mechanism:** OAuth2 REST v2 (base `https://api.ouraring.com/v2`; per-day "document" collections at `/v2/usercollection/{type}`, each a 24h scored summary from 4 a.m.) + optional webhooks (`create`/`update`/`delete` per data_type). Scopes: `email`, `personal`, `daily`, `heartrate`, `workout`, `tag`, `session`, `spo2`. Mechanism class = OAuth REST + webhook (parent §5).

**Oura's shape:** it's the **cleanest bucket-1 wellness source of Batch 1** — sleep stages, resting HR, HRV, respiration all map directly — but **almost everything Oura *scores* is bucket-2** (readiness/sleep/activity scores + their 1–100 contributors are composites, not physiology). **All durations are in SECONDS → ÷60 to the `*_min` keys** (parent assumed minutes for some sources). Oura has **no HR-zone model** (workout `intensity` is `easy/moderate/hard`, *not* Z1–Z5) and **never reports absolute temperature** (deviation only — §4.4).

### 4.1 Sleep (data_type=`sleep`) — `sleep` (detailed period) + `daily_sleep` (score)

| Oura field | Unit | Canonical | Bucket | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sleep.total_sleep_duration` | **s** | `sleep_total_min` | 1 | **÷60** ("Total sleep duration in seconds") — this is asleep total, matching Polar/COROS convention |
| `sleep.deep_sleep_duration` | **s** | `sleep_deep_min` | 1 | ÷60 |
| `sleep.rem_sleep_duration` | **s** | `sleep_rem_min` | 1 | ÷60 |
| `sleep.light_sleep_duration` | **s** | `sleep_light_min` | 1 | ÷60 |
| `sleep.lowest_heart_rate` | bpm | `resting_hr_bpm` | 1 | **the real RHR source** (NOT the readiness `resting_heart_rate` contributor, which is a 1–100 score) |
| `sleep.average_heart_rate` | bpm | `hr_avg_bpm` | 1 | sleep avg; spec warns it differs from the app (30s vs 5-min samples) |
| `sleep.average_hrv` | ms | `hrv_rmssd_ms` | 1 | ⚠️ spec says only `integer` + "Average HRV"; **rMSSD-in-ms is confirmed by Oura's *consumer* docs, not the API contract** — note this |
| `sleep.average_breath` | brpm | `respiration_rate_brpm` | 1 | — |
| `daily_sleep.score` | 0–100 | `sleep_score` | 1 | the genuine device composite (parent §2.3's `sleep_score.device`) — **better source than WHOOP's proprietary %** |
| `sleep.efficiency` | 1–100 **rating** | **bucket-2** | 2 | ⚠️ a 1–100 rating, **NOT a percentage** — don't treat as a fraction |
| `sleep.awake_time`, `time_in_bed`, `latency`, `heart_rate[]`/`hrv[]` samples | s / series | raw | — | no canonical key; `raw_payload` |
| `daily_sleep.contributors.*` (deep_sleep, efficiency, latency, rem_sleep, restfulness, timing, total_sleep) | 1–100 | **bucket-2** | 2 | proprietary sub-scores |

### 4.2 Readiness / recovery (data_type=`wellness`) — `daily_readiness`

**Entirely bucket-2.** `score` (readiness composite) and **all 9 contributors** — `activity_balance`, `body_temperature`, `hrv_balance`, `previous_day_activity`, `previous_night`, `recovery_index`, `resting_heart_rate`, `sleep_balance`, `sleep_regularity` — are 1–100 *contribution scores*, not raw values. **Trap:** the contributor literally named `resting_heart_rate` is the RHR's contribution to the score, **not a bpm** — the real RHR is `sleep.lowest_heart_rate` (§4.1). Record all raw. `temperature_deviation` / `temperature_trend_deviation` → §4.4.

### 4.3 Activity / SpO2 / VO₂max / other daily docs

| Oura field | Unit | Canonical | Bucket | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `daily_activity.total_calories` / `active_calories` | kcal | energy (kcal) | 1 | already kcal ("expended in kilocalories") |
| `daily_activity.steps` | count | `steps` | 1 | ⚠️ `steps` is a canonical target in parent §6.3 (COROS) but is **missing from the §2.3 registry table** — registry omission to reconcile |
| `daily_activity.equivalent_walking_distance` / `target_meters` | m | distance (m) | 1 | raw (derived metric) |
| `daily_spo2.spo2_percentage.average` | % | `spo2_pct` | 1 | ⚠️ value is **nested at `.average`**, not the object itself |
| `vO2_max.vo2_max` | ml/kg/min | `vo2max_running` | 1 | ⚠️ **ONE undifferentiated value — Oura does NOT split running vs cycling**; fills `vo2max_running` only (or a generic), `vo2max_cycling` stays unmapped from Oura. Endpoint casing is literally `/v2/usercollection/vO2_max`. |
| `daily_activity.score` + 6 contributors; `daily_resilience`; `daily_stress`; `daily_cardiovascular_age.vascular_age`; `daily_spo2.breathing_disturbance_index` | 1–100 / enum / sec | **bucket-2** | 2 | proprietary composites/indices — record raw, dormant |

**No Oura source for:** `ftp_w`, `resting_metabolic_rate_kcal`, `vo2max_cycling`, `body_fat_pct`. `body_mass_kg` exists **only as a static `personal_info.weight` (kg)** profile field — not a daily time series (like Strava's `athlete.weight`).

### 4.4 Body temperature — DEVIATION only (do not map to absolute)

Oura never reports absolute body/skin temperature in v2. The only temp fields — `daily_readiness.temperature_deviation` and `temperature_trend_deviation` (both °C, both a **delta from the user's personal baseline**) — have no canonical home → **bucket-2, record raw** (preserve the sign; it's a °C-delta, not a temperature). Do **not** map to any absolute-temperature key.

### 4.5 Workout (data_type=`cardio`) — `workout`

- **`activity` is a FREE-FORM string, NOT an enum** — Oura publishes no closed activity list (the only API-verified literal is `"cycling"`, lowercase). **Map dynamically:** match the `activity` string against our discipline ids (per §1 option C — `running`→D-002, `cycling`→D-006, `swimming`→D-004, `hiking`→D-003, `walking`→walking, `strength_training`→strength_training, …); **any unrecognized string → bucket-3.** Don't hardcode an enum — exact spellings for multi-word activities are unverifiable.
- **Metrics:** `calories`→energy (kcal, —), `distance`→distance (m, —). `intensity` (`easy`/`moderate`/`hard`) → **bucket-2 / coarse label — NOT Z1–Z5** (Oura has no zone model). `source` (`manual`/`autodetected`/`confirmed`/`workout_heart_rate`) → provenance flag. `tag`/`enhanced_tag` → free-form user labels (raw).

### 4.6 Oura bucket-2 (record raw, dormant)

readiness `score` + 9 contributors · `temperature_deviation` / `temperature_trend_deviation` · `daily_sleep.score` + 7 contributors · `daily_activity.score` + 6 contributors · `sleep.efficiency` (1–100 rating) · `daily_resilience` (level + 3 contributors) · `daily_stress` (stress_high/recovery_high/day_summary) · `daily_cardiovascular_age.vascular_age` · `daily_spo2.breathing_disturbance_index` · `workout.intensity`.

**Sources:** Oura official OpenAPI v2 spec (parsed verbatim); cloud.ouraring.com/v2/docs; support.ouraring.com (HRV=rMSSD/ms, temperature-deviation) (fetched 2026-06-17). *Flagged unverified against the API contract: exact multi-word `activity` spellings (only `cycling` confirmed); the SpO2 scope literal (`spo2` vs `spo2Daily`); that `average_hrv` is specifically rMSSD/ms (true per consumer docs, not the field definition).*

## 5. Cross-provider canonical coverage (Batch 1)

Which canonical metric keys each provider can source (1 = mapped, 2 = proprietary/raw, — = N/A):

| Canonical key | Strava | Oura | WHOOP |
|---|---|---|---|
| `resting_hr_bpm` | — | 1 (sleep.lowest_hr) | 1 |
| `hr_avg_bpm` | 1 (activity) | 1 (sleep avg) | 1 (cycle/workout) |
| `hr_peak_bpm` | 1 (activity) | — | 1 (cycle/workout) |
| `hrv_rmssd_ms` | — | 1 | 1 |
| `sleep_total_min` + stages | — | 1 (s→min) | 1 (ms→min) |
| `sleep_score` | — | **1 (device composite)** | 2 (proprietary %) |
| `respiration_rate_brpm` | — | 1 | 1 |
| `spo2_pct` | — | 1 | 1 |
| `body_mass_kg` | 1 (current only) | 1 (static profile) | 1 |
| `ftp_w` | **1** | — | — |
| `vo2max_running` | — | 1 (no disc split) | — |
| `vo2max_cycling` | — | — | — |
| `body_fat_pct`, `resting_metabolic_rate_kcal` | — | — | — |
| discipline (cardio) | 1 (56-enum) | 1 (free-form string) | 1 (~140-enum) |
| HR zones Z1–Z5 | 1 (positional) | **— (no zone model)** | 1 (zone_one–five) |

Takeaways: **Strava = cardio + ftp/weight, zero wellness. Oura = the wellness/sleep/RHR/HRV bucket-1 anchor, zero zones/ftp. WHOOP = wellness + workout cardio + zones, zero ftp/bodyfat/VO2max.** Three providers, three near-disjoint coverage footprints — which is the case *for* a unified canonical store (parent §4) over per-provider tables: an athlete on all three fills a picture no one covers alone, and `sleep_score`/`resting_hr_bpm` arrive from two sources needing one canonical home + a precedence rule.

---

## 6. Candidate NEW canonical entries (Trigger #2 — Andy ratifies; identify, do not pad)

Per parent §7.4 + the CLAUDE.md no-padding rule, these are **flagged, not added**. Until ratified, the value is recorded raw (record-don't-drop):

- **New discipline "Rowing" — mint REVERSED (Andy 2026-06-18). Do NOT mint; Rowing is a training modality, not a race discipline.** This doc's v1 ratified minting `D-033 Rowing` (2026-06-17) off Strava `Rowing`/`VirtualRow` + Wahoo `ROWING`(39)/`FE_ROWER`(22) + TP `rowing`. **Andy reversed it 2026-06-18:** on-water rowing — the traditional sport — is **not frequent in our market and will never appear as a race leg**, which is the bar for a canon discipline (D-ids drive Layer-2A race-discipline composition and race classification, §12). Consequences:
  - Provider Rowing activities stay **bucket-3** — record raw + surface in completed history (`no_canonical_match=true`). **No `discipline_canon.py` change, no layer0 migration, no `D-033`.**
  - **Erg-rowing as a *training* substitute is already covered** by the existing `Rowing ergometer` canonical `equipment_items` machine, which the Layer-4 feasibility cascade (`session_feasibility._DISCIPLINE_INDOOR_MACHINES`) already maps to the paddle disciplines (D-009/010/011/019/032). Equipment/modality, not a new discipline — see §12.
  - Same no-padding instinct as **#679** (preserve specificity, collapse is a backstop) and **#692** (fold the duplicate indoor bikes into the `Cycling trainer` machine rather than mint discipline rows).
- **No new sleep/recovery metric keys needed** — the §2.3 registry covers everything WHOOP/Oura map to bucket-1; their extra numbers (strain, recovery %, readiness, sleep performance %) are correctly **bucket-2** (proprietary composites we don't model), not missing keys.
- **Possible new raw-but-unkeyed dimensions** (not registry keys; just raw columns we don't have): `skin_temp_celsius` (WHOOP), Oura `temperature_deviation` (°C-**delta**, never absolute), `elevation_gain_m` (Strava/WHOOP), `height_m` (WHOOP/Oura body), per-activity `cadence`. These ride in `provider_raw_record.raw_payload` (parent §4.3) — no registry change needed.

**Registry reconciliations the matrix surfaced (parent §2.3 fixes, not new padding):**
- **`steps` is missing from the §2.3 registry table** but is already used as a canonical target in parent §6.3 (COROS) and is sourced by Oura `daily_activity.steps`. Add `steps` (count, no SI conversion) to the §2.3 registry — it's a consumed key the table omits.
- **`vo2max_running` / `vo2max_cycling` split doesn't always map:** Oura emits **one undifferentiated `vo2_max`** (no discipline). The split is fine for Garmin (which does distinguish), but the registry/ingest must tolerate a single-value provider filling only `vo2max_running` (or a generic). Not a new key — a fill-rule note.

**New architectural need the matrix surfaced — multi-source precedence (for the build wave, parent §4):** `sleep_score` arrives from **Oura (device composite)** *and* WHOOP (proprietary %); `resting_hr_bpm` from **Oura (sleep.lowest_hr)** *and* WHOOP; `body_mass_kg` from Strava/Oura/WHOOP/TP; **`ftp_w` from Strava, Wahoo *and* TrainingPeaks**; `hrv_rmssd_ms` also from TP. One canonical key, multiple providers → the canonical store needs a **per-(user, metric) source-precedence rule**. **RATIFIED (Andy 2026-06-18): freshest-timestamp-wins** — the most-recently-*measured* value for a canonical key wins, regardless of source. De-dup the hub-of-hubs re-emits (TrainingPeaks auto-syncs Oura/WHOOP/Garmin Metrics — §11) by **source-of-origin**, so a reading TP merely *relayed* doesn't overwrite the same reading ingested directly from its origin device. Flag for the §4 build; not a vocabulary change.

**Candidate canonical POWER-zone model (Batch 2, Trigger #2/#5 — flag, don't add):** Wahoo exposes a **7-zone power model** (`zone_1..zone_7` + `ftp` + `critical_power`) plus NP/TSS; Strava exposes power zones too. Parent §2.4 mints only a **5-zone HR** model — power zones are a **different axis** (intensity by watts, conventionally the 7-band Coggan model), not normalizable onto HR Z1–Z5. **Recommend: don't force-map; record raw (bucket-2) until we decide whether to mint a canonical power-zone vocab** (its own design, tied to the parent §11.3 training-load question — NP/TSS live there too). Not needed for Batch 1/2 ingest.

**Rowing across providers (all bucket-3, no mint):** Wahoo `ROWING` (39) + `FE_ROWER` (22) + Strava `Rowing`/`VirtualRow` + TP `rowing` all land **bucket-3-with-no-D-id**. Earlier read as strengthening a mint; per the 2026-06-18 reversal they instead confirm Rowing is a **cross-provider training modality** handled by the `Rowing ergometer` machine, not a discipline (§12).

**No new vocab from the FIT path:** Wahoo ships a FIT file at `workout_summary.file.url` (and RWGPS carries `fit_sport`/`fit_sub_sport`) → reuse our existing `garmin_fit_parser` + the #679 FIT category/subtype maps cross-provider. This is the parent §1.2 "consolidate scattered dicts" thesis: **one FIT decoder, many providers** — an architecture note for the build wave, not a vocabulary change.

## 7. Batch plan (remaining roster — subsequent sessions)

| Batch | Providers | Why grouped | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 (this doc)** | Strava, Oura, WHOOP | highest-value consumer; spans cardio + wellness + all 3 buckets | — |
| **2 ✅ (this doc, §10)** | Wahoo, RWGPS | cycling/activity; RWGPS shipped, Wahoo next to wire | DONE — extends the cardio crosswalk; both cardio-only (Wahoo adds `ftp_w`); RWGPS routes → Tier-1 outbound |
| **3 ✅ (this doc, §11)** | TrainingPeaks, Zwift | structured-workout platforms | DONE — TP = real bidirectional API but **partner-access-gated**; Zwift = **no inbound** (via Strava/FIT). Both primarily **outbound** (Wave 3b) |
| **4** | MyFitnessPal | nutrition | **blocked** — ties Layer 2E, which has no nutrition table (parent §11.4); canonical nutrition keys are a Layer-2E co-design, not a like-for-like matrix row |
| **5** | Apple Health, Samsung Health, Google Health Connect | SDK on-device | needs a native client (parent §5); their data model is HealthKit/Health-Connect *types*, not a REST enum — different authoring shape |

Authoring order tracks **wiring reality** (parent §1.3 #1: this layer consumes already-received payloads): map what we can actually ingest first. Unwired providers (TP/Zwift/MFP/SDK) are real future rows but lower-priority than the wired/next ones.

---

## 8. Instrumentation (parent §10, Rule #15)

When the build wave wires these maps, every inbound resolution emits a `print()` carrying `provider`, `data_type`, `source_value`, resolved `canonical_value` or `bucket`, `match_kind`, `confidence` — so a silent mis-map in prod says *which* value, *which* provider, *which* bucket from the logs alone. (No code this doc; flag for the build.)

---

## 9. Gut check (what might be missing / best argument against)

- **The §1 discipline decision is the load-bearing call** — get it wrong and either we discard skimo/paddle signal (option A) or we add ingest plumbing no current consumer reads (option C). I recommend C on fidelity grounds, but it's genuinely Andy's call and it gates every cardio row here.
- **"Observed-not-guaranteed" Strava HR.** Activity-level HR is in real payloads but not Strava's documented schema. If we hard-depend on it and Strava tightens the schema, it breaks. Low risk (it's been stable for years), but the matrix flags it rather than assuming.
- **WHOOP `sleep_total_min` convention** (in-bed vs asleep) and the **zone_one=Z1 inference** are the two places WHOOP's docs don't hand us an exact answer — both flagged inline; both need a one-line decision at build, not more research.
- **Am I authoring rows for a table that doesn't exist?** Yes — by design (Path A, Andy's pick). The risk is the matrix drifts from `provider_value_map`'s final shape. Mitigation: every row here is written in that table's exact column vocabulary (parent §4.2), so the build is a transcription, not a re-derivation.
- **Five providers across two batches, not eleven at once.** Deliberate — a shallow 11-provider pass would be lower-value than depth-first batches. §7 sequences the rest by wiring reality. Best argument against: if Andy wanted *breadth* (a thin all-roster skeleton) over depth, this isn't that — but depth is what makes these rows build-ready.

---

## 10. Batch 2 — RWGPS + Wahoo (cardio/cycling; added 2026-06-17)

Both are **activity/cardio platforms, not wellness devices** — near-zero metric-registry surface (Wahoo adds `ftp_w` + power zones; neither has sleep/HRV/RHR/body/VO2max/resp/SpO2). Authored same as Batch 1 (option C discipline target; official docs fetched 2026-06-17). Both are **schema-stubbed in our app today** (`rwgps_trip_id`/`wahoo_workout_id` dedup columns exist in `init_db.py`/`PROVIDERS_SCHEMA.md`; no live ingest) — the matrix is build-ready, the ingest is the §4-build wave's job.

### 10.1 Ride with GPS (RWGPS) — data_type=`cardio` (+ planned `route` for outbound)

**Mechanism:** REST v1 (`https://ridewithgps.com/api/v1`), OAuth2 (or Basic api_key+token), webhooks per API client for `route`/`trip` `created/updated/deleted` (POST `{user_id, item_url}` + `x-rwgps-signature`; **no retries, no 3xx-follow** → endpoint must 2xx directly, then fetch `item_url`). Mechanism class = OAuth REST + webhook (parent §5).

**Trip (completed) metrics** — units stated by RWGPS; ⚠️ **speed is km/h, not m/s** (the one conversion; distance/elevation are meters — a within-provider unit inconsistency):

| RWGPS field | Unit | Canonical | Bucket | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `distance` | m | distance (m) | 1 | Integer meters |
| `duration` / `moving_time` | s | duration (s) | 1 | total / moving |
| `elevation_gain` / `elevation_loss` | m | elevation (m) | 1 | raw |
| `avg_speed` / `max_speed` | **km/h** | speed (m/s) | 1 | **÷3.6** |
| `avg_hr` / `max_hr` | bpm | `hr_avg_bpm` / `hr_peak_bpm` | 1 | nullable (FIT-sourced) |
| `avg_watts` / `max_watts` | W | power (W) | 1 | nullable |
| `avg_cad` | rpm | cadence | 1 | raw |
| `calories` | "calories" ⚠️ | energy (kcal) | 1 | unit unstamped — assume kcal, verify on a known trip |
| `min_hr` / `min_watts` / `min_cad` | bpm/W/rpm | **bucket-2** | 2 | no canonical "min" slot |
| `is_stationary` | bool | indoor/trainer flag | 1 | corroborates an indoor `activity_type` |
| `activity_type` | enum | **discipline** | 1/3 | enum below |
| `fit_sport` / `fit_sub_sport` | FIT int | discipline tie-breaker | — | fallback when `activity_type` is `generic`/`unknown` |

**`activity_type` enum → discipline** (option C; RWGPS is multi-sport, namespaced `family:variant`):

| RWGPS `activity_type` | Fine D-id | Coarse | Bucket |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cycling:road` | D-006 | cycling | 1 |
| `cycling:gravel` | D-030 | cycling | 1 |
| `cycling:mountain` | D-008 | cycling | 1 |
| `cycling:generic/commute/indoor/virtual/cyclocross/recumbent/hand_cycling` | D-006 (closest) | cycling | 1 |
| `e_biking:*` | D-006 / D-008 | cycling | 1 (e-bike flag in raw) |
| `running:road` | D-002 | running | 1 |
| `running:trail` | D-001 | running | 1 |
| `running:generic/indoor` | D-002 (closest) | running | 1 |
| `walking:hiking` | D-003 | hiking | 1 |
| `walking:generic/indoor/speed` | — | walking | 1 |
| `swimming:generic/lap/open_water` | D-004 | swimming | 1 |
| `snow:alpine_skiing` / `cross_country_skiing` / `snowshoeing` / `snowboarding` | D-022 / D-028 / D-017 / *(none→3)* | — | 1/3 |
| `driving:*`, `motorcycling:*` | *(none)* | — | 3 |
| `training:*` (strength/cardio/yoga/hiit) | *(none)* | — | 3 |
| `other:generic`, `unknown:generic` | *(none)* | — | 3 |

> `training:strength` from a GPS provider → **bucket-3**, NOT the #679 EX-id resolver (that path is for strength-device logs, not a cardio platform's strength tag).

**Routes (planned)** — first-class `route` objects (`GET /routes`); `activity_types` is an **array** (≤3, smaller enum); fields distance/elevation/`surface`/`unpaved_pct` but **no** speed/HR/power. Relevant to **Tier-1/2 outbound** (parent Wave 3) — noted, not specced here.

**N/A for RWGPS:** all wellness/body — no HR zones, sleep, HRV, RHR, body mass/fat, VO2max, FTP, respiration, SpO2 (confirmed against the full v1 schema list). RWGPS is a GPS-track platform.

**Bucket-2:** `min_hr`/`min_watts`/`min_cad`, `is_stationary`, route `unpaved_pct`/`surface`/`track_type`/`terrain`/`difficulty`, `fit_sport`/`fit_sub_sport`.

**Sources:** ridewithgps.com/api/v1/doc/{overview, authentication, webhooks, reference/routes_and_trips, reference/activity_types} (fetched 2026-06-17). ⚠️ live docs are JS-rendered (403 to plain fetch); extracted via Tavily. The one unverified point: `calories` = kcal vs cal.

### 10.2 Wahoo Cloud API — data_type=`cardio` (+ `plan` outbound, power zones)

**Mechanism:** OAuth2 REST (`api.wahooligan.com`) + a `workout_summary` **webhook** (gated by `offline_data` scope); detailed streams arrive as a **FIT file** at `workout_summary.file.url` (not in the JSON). 12 scopes incl. `workouts_read`, `power_zones_read`, `plans_write`. App approval gated (sandbox→prod). Mechanism class = OAuth REST + webhook (parent §5).

**`workout_summary` metrics** — values are JSON strings; mostly SI-canonical (⚠️ contrast RWGPS: Wahoo **speed is m/s**, but **work is JOULES, not kJ**):

| Wahoo field | Unit | Canonical | Bucket | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `distance_accum` | m | distance (m) | 1 | — |
| `duration_total_accum` / `duration_active_accum` | s | duration (s) | 1 | total / active |
| `ascent_accum` | m | elevation (m) | 1 | — |
| `speed_avg` | m/s | speed (m/s) | 1 | **already canonical** (vs RWGPS km/h) |
| `power_avg` / `power_bike_avg` | W | power (W) | 1 | — |
| `heart_rate_avg` | bpm | `hr_avg_bpm` | 1 | — |
| `cadence_avg` | rpm | cadence | 1 | raw |
| `work_accum` | **joules** ⚠️ | energy (kcal) | 1 | **÷4184 → kcal** (NOT kJ; parent assumed kJ); sample magnitudes inconsistent → validate empirically |
| `calories_accum` | kcal ⚠️ | energy (kcal) | 1 | unit unstamped — assume kcal, verify |
| `power_bike_np_last` | W | **bucket-2** (Normalized Power) | 2 | |
| `power_bike_tss_last` | — | **bucket-2** (TSS) | 2 | training-load (parent §11.3) |
| `workout_type_id` | int enum | **discipline** | 1/3 | enum below |
| `file.url` | FIT | stream source | — | **reusable via our `garmin_fit_parser`**; FIT `sport`/`sub_sport` gives finer Road/Gravel/MTB than `workout_type_id` |

**`workout_type_id` → discipline** (option C; the mapped subset — the ~40 unmapped ids are bucket-3 families: snow/skating/gym/motorized/golf/etc.):

| Wahoo `workout_type_id` | Fine D-id | Coarse |
|---|---|---|
| 0 BIKING · 15 _ROAD · 16 _TRACK · 14 _RECUMBENT · 12 _INDOOR · 49/68 indoor-class/virtual · 61 _INDOOR_TRAINER (KICKR) · 70 HANDCYCLING · 64 EBIKING | D-006 | cycling |
| 13 BIKING_MOUNTAIN | D-008 | cycling |
| 11 BIKING_CYCLECROSS | D-006 (closest) | cycling |
| 1 RUNNING · 3 _TRACK · 5 _TREADMILL · 67 _RACE · 71 _INDOOR_VIRTUAL · 19 FE_TREADMILL | D-002 | running |
| 4 RUNNING_TRAIL | D-001 | running |
| 6/7/8 WALKING* · 56 _TREADMILL | — | walking |
| 9 HIKING | D-003 | hiking |
| 10 MOUNTAINEERING | D-018 | hiking |
| 25 SWIMMING_LAP · 26 _OPEN_WATER | D-004 | swimming |
| 29 SKIING_DOWNHILL · 28 SKIING | D-022 | — |
| 30 SKIINGCROSS_COUNTRY | D-028 | — |
| 37 CANOEING | D-011 | — |
| 38 KAYAKING | D-010 | — |
| 41 STAND_UP_PADDLE_BOARD | D-032 | — |
| 39 ROWING · 22 FE_ROWER | *(none — bucket-3 training modality, §6/§12)* | — |
| 27 SNOWBOARDING · 17 motorcycling · 35-36/40 sail/windsurf/kite · 31-34 skating · 42-44/18/20/23 gym/FE · 46 golf · 62 multisport · 66 yoga · 47/255 other/unknown | *(none)* | — |

(bucket: every mapped row = 1; the final catch-all row = 3.) `workout_type_family_id` (0 bike / 1 run / 2 swim / 9 walk / …) is the coarse fallback when an id is unmapped; `workout_type_location_id` sets the indoor flag.

**Power zones + FTP** — `power_zones_read`: `PowerZone{zone_1..zone_7 (W boundaries), ftp (W), critical_power (W)}` → **`ftp_w`** (bucket-1; **2nd source after Strava**). ⚠️ Wahoo uses **7 power zones** vs our canonical **5 HR zones** — a different axis (§6 candidate power-zone model; bucket-2 for now). A dedicated HR-zone endpoint is implied by the portal but **not confirmed** in the REST reference.

**Plans (outbound, Tier-2 note)** — `plans_write` pushes a Wahoo-proprietary **`plan.json`** (Base64; `header` + `intervals[]` with `targets`/`triggers`; units time=s / distance=m / `kj2`=**kJ**; TARGET_TYPE `wu/tempo/lt/map/ac/nm/ftp/cd/recover/rest`). The native Tier-2 target for the parent's Wave 3b. Constraint (community-reported): one target dimension per plan, UTC times.

**N/A for Wahoo:** sleep, HRV, RHR, body mass/fat (no scale), VO2max, respiration, SpO2, recovery. Wahoo = workout + power-zone + plans/routes only.

**Bucket-2:** `power_bike_np_last` (NP), `power_bike_tss_last` (TSS), `critical_power`, the 7-zone power boundaries, plan `kj2`/`map`/`ac`/`nm`, `fitness_app_id`.

**Sources:** cloud-api.wahooligan.com, developers.wahooligan.com/cloud, plan-json-format.pdf + the api-evangelist/wahoo OpenAPI mirror (`work_accum`=joules) (fetched 2026-06-17). ⚠️ unverified: `work_accum` magnitude (samples inconsistent — trust the "joules" definition), `calories_accum` unit, the HR-zone endpoint.

### 10.3 Batch-2 coverage + takeaways

| Canonical | RWGPS | Wahoo |
|---|---|---|
| discipline (cardio) | 1 (namespaced enum) | 1 (~60-id enum) |
| distance / duration / elevation / speed / power / cadence / HR avg+max | 1 | 1 |
| energy `kcal` | 1 (⚠️ cal?) | 1 (⚠️ work=J) |
| `ftp_w` | — | 1 (power zones) |
| HR zones Z1–Z5 | — | ⚠️ power Z1–Z7 only (HR unconfirmed) |
| sleep / HRV / RHR / body / VO2max / resp / SpO2 | — | — |

**Takeaways:** (1) Both cardio-only — they extend the **discipline** crosswalk + cardio metrics, ~no wellness. (2) **`ftp_w` now has two sources** (Strava + Wahoo) → reinforces the §6 multi-source-precedence need. (3) **Unit traps cluster here** — RWGPS speed=km/h vs Wahoo speed=m/s; Wahoo work=joules vs plan `kj2`=kJ; both `calories` unstamped → the §8 instrumentation must log the converted value + source unit. (4) **FIT-file reuse:** Wahoo (and any FIT-emitting provider) ships a FIT at `file.url`; RWGPS carries `fit_sport`/`fit_sub_sport` → our existing `garmin_fit_parser` + the #679 FIT maps are **reusable cross-provider** (parent §1.2 "one decoder, many providers"). (5) **Gut check:** the biggest Batch-2 risk is the energy units (Wahoo joules-vs-kJ, both providers' kcal-vs-cal) — flagged at every row; resolve with one empirical check against a known activity at build, per Rule #14 rather than guessing.

---

## 11. Batch 3 — TrainingPeaks + Zwift (structured-workout platforms; added 2026-06-18)

Both are **destination** platforms (athletes/coaches push plans *to* them) and both are **unwired in our app**. Their inbound pictures are opposite, and the honest finding is that **their value to us is primarily OUTBOUND** (parent Wave 3b — push structured workouts), not inbound:

- **TrainingPeaks** runs a **real bidirectional OAuth2 partner API** — inbound workouts/zones/metrics **are** available — but **access is partner-gated** (explicitly *no personal use*; reportedly *paused to new partners*). **Capability ≠ access:** the wall is approval, not the API. *(This refutes the going-in "TP is outbound-only" assumption.)*
- **Zwift** has **no official inbound API at all** (partner-gated, closed to developers). Its cardio reaches us **via Strava auto-sync or FIT export** — so "Zwift inbound" collapses into our Strava/FIT parsers. Outbound = generate a **`.zwo`** for manual import (no push API).

### 11.1 TrainingPeaks — bidirectional partner API (access-gated)

**Mechanism:** OAuth2 3-legged partner API (`api.trainingpeaks.com` + sandbox; scopes `athlete:profile`/`workouts:read`/`workouts:details`/`workouts:plan`/`metrics:read`). **Partner-approval-gated, no personal use, reportedly paused to new partners** → effectively unavailable to self-serve; aggregators (Terra/Spike) resell the same access. Mechanism class = OAuth REST + webhook (parent §5). **TP itself auto-syncs Metrics from Oura/WHOOP/Garmin/Apple** → it's a hub-of-hubs (a precedence concern, §6).

**Inbound — completed `workout` (`GET /v2/workouts/...`; rich fields Premium-athlete-gated):**

| TP field | Unit | Canonical | Bucket | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Distance` | m | distance (m) | 1 | — |
| `TotalTime` | **decimal HOURS** ⚠️ | duration (s) | 1 | **×3600** (NOT seconds — the headline gotcha) |
| `VelocityAverage` / `Maximum` | m/s | speed (m/s) | 1 | already canonical |
| `PowerAverage` / `PowerMaximum` | W | power (W) | 1 | Premium |
| `HeartRateAverage` / `Maximum` / `Minimum` | bpm | `hr_avg_bpm`/`hr_peak_bpm` | 1 | Premium |
| `CadenceAverage` / `Maximum` | rpm/spm | cadence | 1 | Premium |
| `Calories` | kcal | energy (kcal) | 1 | — |
| `Energy` | **kJ** | energy (kcal) | 1 | **÷4.184** — separate field from `Calories` |
| `ElevationGain` / `Loss` | m | elevation (m) | 1 | — |
| `NormalizedPower` (W), `TssActual`/`IF` | — | **bucket-2** | 2 | Premium; TP training-load (see below) |
| `WorkoutType` | string enum | **discipline** | 1/3 | enum below |

> ⚠️ **No raw recorded-file (.fit/.tcx/.pwx) export endpoint** — recorded data is retrievable only as structured JSON (summary + `/details` time-series); the WOD file-download endpoint returns the *planned* target, not the recording. So TP is **not** a FIT-reuse source (unlike Wahoo).

**`WorkoutType` enum → discipline** (option C; official `POST /plan` strings + PWX read set):

| TP `WorkoutType` | Fine D-id | Coarse | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `swim` | D-004 | swimming | |
| `bike` | D-006 | cycling | |
| `mtb` / `Mountain Bike` | D-008 | cycling | ✅ Bike vs MTB **is** distinguished |
| `run` | D-002 | running | ⚠️ **no road/trail split** — D-001 NOT derivable (single `Run`) |
| `walk` | — | walking | |
| `xc-ski` | D-028 | — | |
| `rowing` | *(none)* | — | **bucket-3 — training modality, not a discipline** (§6/§12; mint reversed 2026-06-18) |
| `strength` | — | strength_training | |
| `x-train`, `Brick`, `Race`, `Day Off`, `Custom`, `other` | *(none)* | — | bucket-3 |

**Zones + FTP** (`Athlete Get Zones`): `HeartRateZones`/`PowerZones`/`SpeedZones` each `{Zones:[{Label,Min,Max}], Threshold}` per `WorkoutType` → maps to **Z1–Z5**; Power `Threshold` = **FTP → `ftp_w`** (3rd source after Strava/Wahoo); HR `Threshold` = LTHR; `RestingHeartRate` → `resting_hr_bpm`.

**Wellness `Metrics`** (`Metrics Get`; auto-synced from Oura/WHOOP/Garmin): `WeightInKilograms` → `body_mass_kg` (kg); `HRV` → `hrv_rmssd_ms` (RMSSD per docs); `Steps`; ⚠️ `Stress` / `SleepQuality` are **strings** (not numeric scales) → bucket-2. Schema is explicitly non-exhaustive; sleep-*hours*, body-fat, mood etc. unverified at the API field level.

**Outbound (Wave 3b Tier-2)** — `POST /v2/workouts/plan` with a `Structure` (`Step`/`Repetition`; `Length.Unit` ∈ {`Second`,`Meter`}; `IntensityTarget.Unit` ∈ {`PercentOfFtp`,`PercentOfMaxHr`,`PercentOfThresholdHr`,`PercentOfThresholdSpeed`,`Rpe`}). ⚠️ **%-of-threshold only** (no absolute watts/pace), **no native ramp**, **planned ≤7 days ahead**, Premium athlete required. Note for Wave 3b, not specced here.

**Bucket-2:** `NormalizedPower`/`TssActual`/`IF` (Premium); CTL/ATL/TSB (the PMC — **not on the workout object, no endpoint** → recompute from per-day TSS); `Stress`/`SleepQuality` strings. TSS®/IF®/NP® are trademarked, no cross-provider standard (parent §11.3 training-load question).

**Sources:** github.com/TrainingPeaks/PartnersAPI/wiki (FAQ, OAuth, Workouts-Object/Get/Details/Create, Workout-Structure-Object, Athlete-Get-Zones, Metrics-Get) (fetched 2026-06-18). ⚠️ unverified: full scope list, new-partner onboarding status, numeric workout-type ids (third-party only), Metrics fields beyond weight/HRV/steps.

### 11.2 Zwift — no inbound connector; `.zwo` outbound only

**Mechanism:** **No official public read API** (confirmed — partner-gated, closed to hobby devs; the unofficial reverse-engineered mobile API is ToS/GDPR-risky → **excluded**).

**Inbound: none direct.** Zwift activities auto-sync to **Strava** (and TrainingPeaks) and save locally as **FIT**. So Zwift cardio reaches us **through the Strava (§2) and FIT paths** — map it there, not via a Zwift connector. The FIT carries everything we canonicalize (distance→m, time→s, speed→m/s, power→W, HR→bpm), so **no fidelity is lost** by the indirect route. **Matrix entry: Zwift = no inbound `provider_value_map` rows; ingest via Strava/FIT.**

**Outbound (Wave 3b Tier-2):** generate a **`.zwo`** workout (XML; `sportType` ∈ bike/run/swim; blocks `Warmup`/`SteadyState`/`IntervalsT`/`Ramp`/`Cooldown`/`FreeRide`; `Power` = **fraction of FTP**, `Duration` = **seconds**). Anchor on `ftp_w`. ⚠️ **power-target based, not HR-zone** (HR plans approximate via %FTP), and **delivery is manual file-import only** (drop into `Documents/Zwift/Workouts/{id}/`) — **no push API**.

**Sources:** support.zwift.com (activities/FIT, custom-workouts import), forums.zwift.com (official "no hobby dev accounts"), support.strava.com (Zwift auto-upload); `.zwo` reference via the h4l community doc (flagged unofficial) (fetched 2026-06-18).

### 11.3 Batch-3 takeaways

| Canonical | TrainingPeaks | Zwift |
|---|---|---|
| discipline (cardio) | 1 (10-type enum; no trail-run) | — (via Strava/FIT) |
| distance/duration/speed/power/HR/cadence/energy/elevation | 1 (⚠️ `TotalTime`=hours) | — (via FIT) |
| `ftp_w` | 1 (power Threshold) | — |
| HR zones Z1–Z5 | 1 (zones + LTHR) | — |
| `resting_hr_bpm`, `body_mass_kg`, `hrv_rmssd_ms` | 1 (Metrics; Premium/partner-gated) | — |
| inbound availability | ⚠️ **partner-approval-gated** | ❌ **none** |

**Takeaways:** (1) **TP is capability-rich but access-gated** — full bidirectional partner API; the blocker is approval, not the API. List it as a real provider with an "access: partner-approval" caveat, not a stub. (2) **`ftp_w` now has *three* sources** (Strava, Wahoo, TP) — the §6 multi-source precedence is now load-bearing. (3) **TP's `rowing` WorkoutType is bucket-3** — not a discipline (the §6 mint was reversed 2026-06-18; Rowing is a training modality, §12). (4) **TP is a hub-of-hubs** (auto-aggregates Oura/WHOOP/Garmin Metrics) → if we ingest both TP *and* Oura/WHOOP directly we'll double-count; precedence/dedup matters. (5) **Zwift collapses into Strava/FIT** — confirms "one FIT decoder, many providers" (parent §1.2); don't build a Zwift connector. (6) **Both are primarily Wave-3b OUTBOUND** (TP `Structure` push, Zwift `.zwo`) — this inbound matrix records them for completeness, but the outbound serializer wave is where they pay off.

## 12. Discipline vs. training-modality / equipment (framing — Andy 2026-06-18)

The Batch-1→3 crosswalks surfaced a cluster of provider activity types with **no canonical discipline** — Rowing, Stair-stepping, Elliptical, Walking, Yoga, HIIT/CrossFit, RollerSki, indoor/virtual rides. The instinct (one this doc's v1 acted on, minting `D-033 Rowing`) is to grow the discipline canon to cover them. **That is the wrong layer, and Andy reversed it 2026-06-18.** Most of these are **training modalities or equipment**, not individual sports/disciplines — and the data model already has the right homes for them. A new D-id is reserved for a true sport/discipline that **can appear as a race leg** (D-ids drive Layer-2A race-discipline composition and race classification). **If it will never be a race leg, it does not get a discipline id.**

This was also weighed against, and is the reason we did **not** add, a `discipline_type` ("race" / "training" / …) flag column on `layer0.disciplines`: that would re-encode, *on the discipline table*, a race-vs-training split the schema **already expresses by where the row lives** (below). A training-only modality simply never receives a D-id, so it is structurally impossible for it to leak in as a race leg — no flag needed.

### 12.1 The three existing homes (none of them the discipline canon)

The research behind this call is the **Layer-4 feasibility cascade** — `layer4/session_feasibility.py`, the `EXACT → PROXY → INDOOR → STRENGTH → REALLOCATE` resolution (`resolve_terrain_feasibility` / `resolve_craft_terrain_feasibility`). It already models "a discipline trained indoors / on a machine" as distinct from "a discipline," via the terrain a session requires → the equipment that satisfies it → the race discipline it serves:

1. **Equipment / indoor machine** — `_DISCIPLINE_INDOOR_MACHINES` maps a discipline to the canonical `layer0.equipment_items` machine(s) that can stand in for it when no outdoor terrain is feasible. The machines we'd have minted as disciplines **already exist** and already carry the modality signal:
   - `Treadmill` → D-001/002/003 · `Stair climber` → D-003/017/018/024 · `Ski erg` → D-021/022/028 · `Cycling trainer`/`Assault bike` → D-006/007/008/030/031 · `Rowing ergometer`/`Paddle ergometer` → D-009/010/011/019/032.
   - **#692 set the precedent:** the duplicate indoor bikes were **folded into the `Cycling trainer` machine**, not minted as disciplines. A "cycling trainer" is equipment a cyclist uses indoors — not a sport.
2. **Non-discipline category** — `discipline_canon.classify_non_discipline` keeps strength / mobility / recovery as **category rows with `discipline_id = NULL`** (`CATEGORY_STRENGTH`, `CATEGORY_MOBILITY`), plus the recovery/mobility session kind (#698). Yoga, HIIT, CrossFit, Pilates land here on the *plan* side.
3. **Coarse `_plan_sport_type`** — `walking` is already one of the 6 coarse values (§1); it has no D-id and therefore can never be mistaken for a race discipline.

### 12.2 Disposition of every flagged activity

| Provider activity (examples) | A discipline? | Home | Inbound bucket |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rowing, on-water + erg — Strava `Rowing`/`VirtualRow`, Wahoo `ROWING`/`FE_ROWER`, TP `rowing` | **No** | `Rowing ergometer` machine (training substitute for the paddle disciplines) | **3** — record raw + surface |
| Stair-stepping — Strava `StairStepper`, Garmin `stair_climbing` | **No** | `Stair climber` machine (→ D-003/017/018/024) | **3** + indoor-machine flag |
| Elliptical — Strava `Elliptical`, WHOOP/Wahoo | **No** | no exact machine; closest = treadmill/indoor cardio | **3** |
| Walking — Strava `Walk`, RWGPS `walking:*`, Wahoo `WALKING` | **No** | coarse `_plan_sport_type = walking` | **1 (coarse-only)** |
| RollerSki — Strava `RollerSki` | **No** — dryland form of XC ski | maps to **D-028** as a dryland proxy; raw flags "rollerski" | **1** (D-028) |
| Yoga / Pilates | **No** | `CATEGORY_MOBILITY` + mobility/recovery session kind (#698) | **3** |
| HIIT / CrossFit / Functional Fitness | **No** | `CATEGORY_STRENGTH` (conditioning); not a barbell log, not a race | **3** |
| Indoor / virtual ride — Strava `VirtualRide`, Wahoo `_INDOOR_TRAINER`/`_VIRTUAL`, RWGPS `cycling:indoor/virtual` | **Yes** (cycling) | the cycling D-id **+** `Cycling trainer` machine flag | **1** (D-006) + indoor flag |
| Snowboard, Surf, racquet/ball sports, golf, skating, sailing | **No** | none — genuinely unprogrammed | **3** |

### 12.3 The two genuine gaps (both small; neither is a new discipline)

1. **Inbound indoor/machine flag.** The cascade *emits* `machine` outbound (it prescribes "indoor `Cycling trainer` at <locale>"); the symmetric **inbound** need is recording *which* machine a completed activity used — Strava `VirtualRide`/`StairStepper`, RWGPS `is_stationary`, Wahoo `workout_type_location_id`. This rides in `provider_raw_record.raw_payload` (no registry/vocab change) and lets a completed indoor session corroborate the athlete's equipment pool. **Build-wave note (§4).**
2. **Nothing else.** Stair/erg/treadmill/rollerski machines already exist in `_DISCIPLINE_INDOOR_MACHINES`; walking is already coarse; mobility/strength categories already exist. No new equipment vocab, no new discipline.

### 12.4 The bar (use this for the next provider batch)

When a provider activity type has no canonical discipline, classify in this order — **mint a discipline only as the last resort, and only if it can be a race leg:**

1. An existing discipline done **indoors / on a machine**? → that discipline + the machine (`_DISCIPLINE_INDOOR_MACHINES`); add to `equipment_items` only if the machine is genuinely absent.
2. **Strength / mobility / recovery**? → the non-discipline category, not a discipline.
3. A **coarse** home with no race meaning (walking)? → coarse `_plan_sport_type`, no D-id.
4. A **real sport we don't program** (pickleball, golf, surfing — *including on-water rowing*)? → **bucket-3**, record raw + surface in history.
5. **Only** a genuine sport that will appear as a **race leg in our market** → flag a candidate discipline (Trigger #2, Andy ratifies). Rowing was tested against this bar 2026-06-18 and resolved at step 4.
